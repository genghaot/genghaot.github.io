                     <p>Climate change poses a real challenge to lifestyles and ecosystems. It is definitely possible for societies to make a difference, and more attention should be given to the contributions of individuals and communities in making positive environmental impact.</p>
                     <p>Accenture presented us with a challenge to develop bottom-up initiatives using technology to build greener neighbourhoods. Over the course of three days, I worked as part of a three-person team to create a solution for residents to make investments that reduce costs and benefit the environment.</p>

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>In 2015, the Singapore government introduced plans to develop a more sustainable and liveable city by 2030. Currently, its initiatives to make homes more efficient in their resource consumption are largely limited to “smart homes” targeting only public housing, while we found that the average monthly energy consumption of a private home in Singapore can get up to 25% higher. We wanted to target communities in private housing such as condominiums, and encourage them to adopt sustainable practices.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>We conducted an online survey of households to learn more about their resource consumption patterns and attitudes towards sustainable practices. We found that they:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Feel that they cannot reduce their utility expenses much further</li>
                            <li>Find managing their utility expenses <strong>difficult</strong>, as monitoring resource consumption is too <strong>tedious</strong></li>
                            <li>Tend to lead fast-paced lifestyles and <strong>lack the habit</strong> of conserving resources</li>
                            <li>Believe that setting goals is <strong>helpful but troublesome</strong> in managing utility expenses</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h3>User Needs &amp; Goals</h3>
                    <p>By learning about their pain points, we decided that our solution should encompass:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Convenient and streamlined method of monitoring resource consumption</li>

                            <li>Efficient and meaningful goal-setting that motivates users to make progress</li>

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>The pressing issue was the difficulty in managing their utility expenses, and we felt that a feasible way to tackle this was to encourage households to implement an intelligent home control system with smart plugs and meters, in line with Accenture's objective to support residents in making investments. The assumption we made for this concept was that intelligent home technologies are prevalent and capable of generating usage insights.</p>

                    We decided to design a mobile app for residents living in private estates to easily monitor, manage and set goals for their resource consumption, with an incentive system that benefits the community through individual efforts. After putting pencil to paper by laying out the user flow of the app and drawing key screens, I converted my sketches into high-fidelity mockups.

                    Usage data collected from intelligent home technologies is displayed and updated daily in 'My Expenses'. Users will not have to review a bill at the end of each month to keep track of their utility expenses. The data is also broken down into easy-to-understand insights and tips, supporting users in adopting sustainable practices.

                    In line with supporting users in setting reasonable goals and cutting down their utility expenses, we decided to draw on the average usage data of their neighbourhood to give them a sense of where they stand.

                    Besides using smart plugs and meters to monitor energy usage, users have the flexibility of turning specific appliances on and off, either independently or based on a schedule. Also, they can easily plug in an appliance and set it up on the app.

                    We introduced 'My Community', where residents can accumulate points for their private estates through meeting savings goals or contributing to sustainable community projects such as compost bins to reduce food waste.
