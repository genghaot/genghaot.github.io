                            <p>Sephora Digital powers Sephora's online shopping platforms across Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. During my time with the company, I had the privilege of working in a start-up environment while shaping the digital experience of Sephora, one of the most recognisable names in beauty.</p>

                    <p>As a UX design intern at Sephora Digital, I was fortunate to receive mentorship from other designers in the UX team and work directly with product managers and developers to influence several projects across various stages of our design process.</p>

                    <h2>Beauty Pass Page Redesign</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.sephora.sg/beauty-pass" target="_blank">Beauty Pass</a> is Sephora's exclusive loyalty program that provides members with access to a wide range of rewards. A customer becomes a member by creating an account and making an online purchase on Sephora. A point is earned with every dollar spent, and the three membership tiers in increasing order are White, Black and Gold. Members are assigned to a tier based on the amount they spend on Sephora, which is refreshed every year.</p>
                    <p>With another designer in my team, I redesigned the Beauty Pass page which explains the loyalty program to members. Our goal <strong>was to convert more Sephora customers to Beauty Pass members, which would be reflected in an increase in account creation through the Beauty Pass page</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Designing a seamless application process</h3>
                        <p>The other goal of the website was to <strong>convert and ease applicants into the recruitment process</strong>. I worked closely with Ariel, the UX design lead on my team to create wireframes and hi-fi mockups of the recruitment flow, taking into account the operational requirements we established with the project managers and teacher management team.</p>
                        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-recruitment-application-flow.jpg"></p>
                        <p>The recruitment flow had to guide applicants seamlessly along the process and instil confidence in their application. Filling out the application form can be stressful, so we broke it into sections which can be jumped to easily via a progress indicator. Changes are automatically saved to provide assurance to applicants that once logged in, their information will not be lost if they had to leave halfway through.</p>
                        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-recruitment-scheduling.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Once their application information is approved, applicants move on to the next step by signing up for an interview slot. A challenge is that the teacher management team has to coordinate multiple interviews across time zones, but it was also confusing for applicants to follow Beijing time. We decided to display the interview slots according to the time in their location, then adjust them in the backend.</p>
                        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-application-outcomes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>It was important that we valued the time that applicants take to apply for a job with us. At each stage of the process, we made sure to give them feedback on how they are doing and where they are at. I created some simple illustrations to make our brand more personable, and worked with Ariel to shape the messaging of the feedback and information they needed to know at each stage.</p>

                        <h3>Supporting teachers to do their best work</h3>
                        <p>Ariel and I noticed that we could do more to help teachers get the most out of the platform, as addressing their needs improves the classroom experience for students too. We started a side project to improve our current platform for teachers. We set up Skype interviews with a group of teachers and they shared their personal goals and pain points on working with us.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-12 col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-teacher-persona-amanda.jpg"></div>
                            <div class="col-12 col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-teacher-persona-david.jpg"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Based on our research, I developed two personas to help scope our project.</p>
                        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-teacher-portal-wireframes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Then, we collaborated on <strong>Figma</strong> to brainstorm how we could develop an information architecture for the platform which scales appropriately to accommodate new features, yet integrates currently disparate features together to deliver a one-stop solution for teachers.</p>
                        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-new-teacher-portal-dashboard.jpg"></p>
                        <p>The aim of the redesigned dashboard is to let teachers see the most important information they need to know at one glance, so they are aware of what has changed and decide if they want to dive deeper into a section.</p>
                        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-new-teacher-portal-classes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Classes are the main focus of the teachers. We decided to display their classes in a list view, categorising them by completed, scheduled and missed. This way, they can quickly glance through a greater number of classes and filter them efficiently through the search mechanism.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-12 col-md-10 mx-auto"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/sayabc-new-teacher-portal-income.jpg"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>The income page provides transparency to the teachers on how much they are earning with the platform. It aims to give them an overview of the progress they are making, and assure them that their work is being taken into account.</p>

                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <p>I'm grateful for the opportunity to work in an interdisciplinary team to communicate our brand and provide value to teachers. I learned a lot about bridging differences in perspectives across product managers, engineers and other stakeholders, and got to know what it was like to move fast while producing refined deliverables in an agile environment.</p>
