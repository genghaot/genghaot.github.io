                <div class="text-block">
                    Getting the right gift as an individual or a group for special occasions can be challenging. Gift givers may experience frustrations in getting the practical and 'perfect' gift for their recipient due to a lack of ideas or time. On the other hand, the gift may not be well-received by the recipient, as it may not be practical or suitable for them.
                </div>
                <div class="text-block">
					I worked in a team of four to come up with Gift Bot, an intelligent mobile assistant for users to find the perfect gift for their loved ones in an effective, fuss-free and delightful way. Over the course of four months, we conducted research with real users, conceptualised and evaluated possible ideas and created an interactive prototype, demo video and poster for our final product.

            	<h2>Research</h2>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		We conducted qualitative interviews with 16 individuals and collected 80 responses via a Google Forms survey to better understand the current pain points facing gift givers and recipients in getting and receiving the right gift. This helped us scope and define the problem we are designing for in terms of our users' needs and goals and come up with design requirements in response to the problem. In addition, our research helped us to gain market validation, gauge user interest and assess the feasibility, desirability and viability of our initial ideas.
            	</div>
            	<h3>User Needs &amp; Goals</h3>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		From our research, we gleaned several key insights into our users:
            		<ul>
            			<li>Users aim to meet the needs of their recipients and make them feel loved and appreciated when buying a gift, and to express their sincerity, or appreciate and reciprocate a kind act or favour.</li>
            			<li>Most users buy gifts in view of special occasions such as birthdays or festive celebrations, and may also buy gifts to treat or reward themselves or others.</li>
            			<li>Many users find getting the right gift for their loved ones to be time-consuming and worrying as they are unsure whether they are making the right choice for the gift they are getting, especially when they have budget constraints, lack reviews and opinions, or are buying as a group.</li>
            			<li>Many users search for gift ideas online, as it helps to narrow down their list of possible gifts, though many find the research and decision-making process tedious and long.</li>
            		</ul>
            	</div>
            	<h3>Task Analysis</h3>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		We also asked our interviewees to briefly walk us through their process of buying a gift, and got a better idea of how they would usually go about solving the problem of getting the right gift.
            	</div>
            	<div class="image-block"><img src="img/gift bot/gift bot task analysis.png"></div>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		From the hierarchical task analysis, we learned that the existing approaches our interviewees take in finding the right gift tend to be open-ended and lacking in focus. They usually start off not knowing exactly what they want apart from a vague idea or a general set of keywords, and their process of finding a good gift and narrowing down their search typically involves a degree of serendipitous discovery. We saw potential in enhancing the existing process of finding the right gift through helping them scope and define their search from the get-go, and making the process of getting inspired and discovering something new more delightful and less time-consuming.
            	</div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
            	<h2>Design</h2>
            	<h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		After our research was done, we began conceptualising and representing our ideas in a range of low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups through a parallel prototyping session. Each of us came up with an individual design concept addressing some or all of our design requirements, after which we evaluated, combined and revised our ideas before starting an iterative design process.
            	</div>
            	<div class="image-block">
            		<img src="img/gift bot/gift bot initial user flow.png">
            		<div class="caption">User flow of my design concept</div>
            	</div>
            	<h3>Evaluation of Design Concept</h3>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		I finalised the user flow of my design concept, translated it into a series of high-fidelity mockups that could support basic interactivity, and tested the prototype with three prospective users. Some of the key issues that arose include:
            		<ul>
            			<li>Manual search features appear to be more obvious than the conversational interface, i.e. discoverability of the app's features can be improved</li>
            			<li>Social and collaborative aspects of the application are not obvious</li>
            			<li>Certain symbols such as the filter icon are ambiguous</li>
            			<li>Some users expect to chat with Gift Bot for suggestions, while others prefer to view a consolidated list of gift ideas</li>
            		</ul>
            	</div>
            	<h3>Interactive Prototype</h3>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		At the end of the parallel prototyping process, we considered the pros and cons of each member's design concept, and integrated the best elements of each concept into a fully interactive prototype.
            	</div>
            	<h4>First-time Usage</h4>
            	<div class="image-row">
            		<div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-2 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/launch.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/set_up_account.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/create_profile.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2 col-sm-2 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/create_profile_2.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/profile_complete.png"></div>
            	</div>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		When users launch Gift Bot for the first time, they will be asked to create a new account. They will first enter their basic account details, followed by their basic profile details. Users will then be invited to further add information for their profile, such as their interests, hobbies and short biography. Each user profile provides data for the proposed artificial intelligence (AI) bot to suggest gift ideas and make recommendations.
            	</div>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		We focused on keeping the screens simple and breaking the process into logical steps. To prevent cognitive overload, we avoided making the user fill in a large amount of information at once.
            	</div>
            	<h4>Categorisation, Filtering &amp; Wishlists</h4>
            	<div class="image-row">
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/home.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/search_results.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/product_details_2.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/profile.png"></div>
            	</div>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		Gift Bot offers a wide variety of gift ideas categorised by type, such as electronics, experiences, beauty, etc. We believed that categories provide users with an organised framework to begin their search with just one glance. They can also search for gifts using the search bar, and filter and sort the search results. Tapping on a product thumbnail shows the various details about the product such as photos, price, description, rating and reviews, and liking a product adds it to the user's wishlist on their profile page.
            	</div>
            	<h4>Conversational Suggestions &amp; Collaboration</h4>
            	<div class="image-row">
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/gift_bot_chat.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/gift_bot_suggestions.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/group_chat.png"></div>
            		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2"><img src="img/gift bot/friends_suggestions.png"></div>
            	</div>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		Gift Bot has a chat feature where users can open an individual chat with the AI bot, or start a group chat with it. They can then converse with the bot for gift suggestions by specifying their preferences such as their recipient's likes, dislikes, needs, wants, personality, etc. If the recipient has a profile in the application, its details will also be taken into account when the bot generates gift suggestions. When viewing suggestions, users can tap on the respective product thumbnails in the chat for more details, or toggle between the chat interface and 'Gift Bot Suggestions', which shows a list of all the suggestions that have been made so far. We thought that adopting a tab structure would reduce the effort needed to remember a particular suggestion, as users can simply refer to it with a single tap.
            	</div>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		Members of a group chat can share products they find in the application as a suggestion to the chat, which will also appear under the 'Friends' Suggestions' tab. To facilitate group consensus, members can also collectively vote for the best gift to get.
            	</div>
            </div>

            <div class="row greybg">
            	<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
            	<div class="text-block">
            		This project was an eye-opening learning experience. We had the opportunity to imagine the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and try our hand at designing conversational interfaces. We also worked collaboratively with Axure Share, so every team member had a direct hand in influencing the appearance and functionality of the final product, but this was not without its challenges. Working with individuals from technical backgrounds meant that we sometimes approached the problem from different viewpoints, and although the interactivity of our prototype could not have been implemented without technical knowledge, good design is needed to ensure that it is delightful and seamless to use. As far as possible, we adhered to a consistent, easy-to-understand visual language across our design workflow, and tried to gave our users a sense of control, freedom and flexibility over their experience with Gift Bot.
            	</div>
                <div class="text-block">
                    At this point, Gift Bot is far from complete, and we have also identified several areas of improvement. We could consider syncing the users' personal calendars with Gift Bot so that they will be reminded of events and occasions they may like to find a gift for, take advantage of AI to let our users see a list of gifts their friends may like whenever they visit their friends' profiles, and turn wishlists into a personal bookmarking feature for users to keep track of the gifts they've bought or are interested in. Overall, the possibilities are endless, and I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to work through even just a few of them with a great team.
