                     <h2>Overview</h2>
                     <p>VIPKID is an education technology company which offers an international English learning experience to Chinese children by engaging certified English teachers from around the world. Since its inception in 2013, the company has grown to become a major player in the intensely competitive market for online English education in China.</p>
                     <p>While I was in Beijing, I joined VIPKID as a product design intern for SayABC, an emerging platform that connects Chinese students with international English teachers in a 1-to-4 interactive classroom setting. It aims to ultimately give more Chinese children the opportunity to receive an English education at an affordable price.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>It is important for SayABC to pay attention to the quality of its teachers to remain competitive. I was part of a team that sought to deeply understand the needs, goals and pain points of the teachers we work with, in order to implement solutions and identify opportunities that create value for them.</p>
                    <p>When I joined, SayABC was still in a nascent stage of development. As a first step, we aimed to <strong>differentiate our platform as a top-of-mind choice among teachers, in order to attract and recruit more of them to teach with us.</strong></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 mx-auto text-block">
                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>We conducted a competitive analysis of the online English education landscape in China and surveyed 30 current SayABC teachers on their work and experience on the platform. We wanted to understand how our competitors were solving the needs of teachers in the market and find out what was most important to our teachers about their work.</p>
                    <p>From our research, we found that:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Most companies cited <strong>convenience, flexibility, supportive staff and professional development</strong> as important reasons to work with them.</li>
                            <li>We should <strong>empower teachers to be educators</strong> by helping them feel that they are doing impactful work and building meaningful relationships with their students.</li>
                            <li>Highlighting the <strong>extensive support of our staff and teacher network</strong> may be useful in instilling confidence among the teachers.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Inspiring teachers to discover the platform</h3>
                    <p>I was tasked to design the marketing and recruitment website for teachers. Our main strategy was to emphasise the idea that an international learning experience allows young Chinese learners to unlock their full potential in life. Given that the 1-to-4 classroom setting of our platform is both more interactive and more challenging than the typical 1-to-1 model, we chose to appeal to teachers by highlighting their passion for <strong>moulding students into confident learners</strong>.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 mx-auto text-block">
                    <p>At the same time, we wanted to focus on the salient factors that make teaching online attractive. Based on the insights we gathered on our teachers, we focused on <strong>benefits, purpose and support</strong> as our key value propositions.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Designing a seamless application process</h3>
                    <p>The other goal of the website was to <strong>convert and ease applicants into the recruitment process</strong>. I worked closely with Ariel, the UX design lead on my team to create wireframes and hi-fi mockups of the recruitment flow, taking into account the operational requirements we established with the project managers and teacher management team.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 mx-auto text-block">
                    <p>The recruitment flow had to guide applicants seamlessly along the process and instil confidence in their application. Filling out the application form can be stressful, so we broke it into sections which can be jumped to easily via a progress indicator. Changes are automatically saved to provide assurance to applicants that once logged in, their information will not be lost if they had to leave halfway through.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row image-block wow fadeIn">

                    <p>Once their application information is approved, applicants move on to the next step by signing up for an interview slot. A challenge is that the teacher management team has to coordinate multiple interviews across time zones, but it was also confusing for applicants to follow Beijing time. We decided to display the interview slots according to the time in their location, then adjust them in the backend.</p>

                    <p>It was important that we valued the time that applicants take to apply for a job with us. At each stage of the process, we made sure to give them feedback on how they are doing and where they are at. I created some simple illustrations to make our brand more personable, and worked with Ariel to shape the messaging of the feedback and information they needed to know at each stage.</p>

                    <h3>Supporting teachers to do their best work</h3>
                    <p>Ariel and I noticed that we could do more to help teachers get the most out of the platform, as addressing their needs improves the classroom experience for students too. We started a side project to improve our current platform for teachers. We set up Skype interviews with a group of teachers and they shared their personal goals and pain points on working with us.</p>

                    <p>Then, we collaborated on <strong>Figma</strong> to brainstorm how we could develop an information architecture for the platform which scales appropriately to accommodate new features, yet integrates currently disparate features together to deliver a one-stop solution for teachers.</p>

                    <p>The aim of the redesigned dashboard is to let teachers see the most important information they need to know at one glance, so they are aware of what has changed and decide if they want to dive deeper into a section.</p>

                    <p>Classes are the main focus of the teachers. We decided to display their classes in a list view, categorising them by completed, scheduled and missed. This way, they can quickly glance through a greater number of classes and filter them efficiently through the search mechanism.</p>
